# weather.gov in Celsius
This Chrome Extension will add Celsius values to the Extended Forecast section on The National Weather Service's site weather.gov
I created this because weather.gov only supplies Celcius values for the current temperature and wanted to extend the values to the long term forecast.

## Use Extension:
1. Navigate to https://weather.gov
2. Enter location in the input box with label 'Local forecast by "City, St" or ZIP code'
3. Celsius values will appear in the 'Extended Forecast' section
